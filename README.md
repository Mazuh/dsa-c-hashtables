# Data Structures & Algorithms: (C) Hash Tables

Implementation of the hash table and derived structures,
inspired by the talk of
[Luciano Ramalho in PyBR2023](https://youtu.be/JfyB2YGRuDw?list=PLDC3uVLxaEQ1Bkj73iMqDTd8uDzTfjyzu&t=891).

The interface however is inspired by the
[hash table management from Linux Manual](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/hsearch.3.html).

## Setting up
