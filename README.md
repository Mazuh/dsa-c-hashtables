# Data Structures & Algorithms: (C) Hash Tables

Implementation of the hash table and derived structures,
inspired by a talk of [Luciano Ramalho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianoramalho/) during
[PyBR2023](https://2023.pythonbrasil.org.br/).

The API for the set data structure is somewhat similar
to [Java HashSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html).

## Setting up

```sh
make
```

## Example of usage

TODO.
